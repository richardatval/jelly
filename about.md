# Rooms that make a difference

Booking your conference or meeting at Orange Rooms will help to support local communities.

The proceeds from all bookings go to [Voluntary Action LeicesterShire](http://www.valonline.org.uk), a charity that offers support to over 4000 community and voluntary groups who provide vital services throughout Leicester and Leicestershire.

[<span class="caps">VALUES</span>](http://www.valuessupport.co.uk) supports people with learning disabilities and is just one of the thousands of groups that benefit from proceeds made by Orange Rooms.

### Environmental Building

In 2002, we transformed a derelict Victorian knitwear factory into an impressive eco-friendly workspace that was awarded Leicester’s first Environment City Building award.

The £1.5 million transformation included solar panels on the roof, reclaimed wooden floors and a rainwater harvesting system. This enables the building to be self-sustaining in its use of energy.

Go green book your meeting or conference at Orange Rooms.
